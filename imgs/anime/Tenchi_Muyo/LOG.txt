Welcome friends to my stitched fragmention madness. As a CTR admirer I have this internal need to find the best quality releases out there or mux/encode them myself. The age old question is, why did I do this for something I haven't even watched? You heard right I saw nothing. The short answer is I’m a madman that just seeing a poster from one of the animes in the series would lead me to do it. Now for the long version: The story starts in an anime YouTuber’s discord server. I just lurking around looking at the meme channels and rarely branching out to the main ones. It just so happens that this one time I peeked in, a guy posted a banner and a few pics of a anime without saying its name. So I did just as anyone would to find out what it was so a reverse image search I did. It wasn’t as quick as I would had hoped but at lest it gave me a name to search on MAL. This is when I found out about something and this anime was one of those animes like Case Closed with all kinds of spin offs. “OH Great” I  thought to myself, then I proceeded to NYAA to look things up while hoping to someone made a pack already. This is when I learned about something else that made things harder… This anime has two names basically “Muyou!” and  “Muyo!” making searching for variations annoying. But by then if their was a complete pack I would have found it by now. So I moved to my contacts, I hit up Golumpa’s discord asking around if anyone had it all. Sadly no one did, however some NOOBS tried to point me in the right direction but all that did was lead me on a wild goose chase (XDCC).  While this was going on a few people showed interest in the anime. Then Doc said he’ll try to find some himself… but this was short lived and forgot about it the next day (baka). I learned about this when I asked if he had any luck the following day. This is when we jokingly made a deal if I tracked everything down and made a torrent he’ll watch “A Place Further than the Universe” (good anime btw). The Game is ON NOW… thus marks the start of this grand project. Got on AniDB and got to work tracking things down. Big thanks to animebytes as most on this torrent came from there and the rest came from nyaa. FYI BakaBT only had like 3 out of the 20 and animetorrents had like one… So not good sources for old anime.

Notes for V2: I spent too many hours on this project as most of it was dealing with “Tenchi in Tokyo”. Koby got me the JDVDs but I failed to encode something close to Saier release’s quality. So in the end I gave up and just used it, let's hope the nyaa mods understand. But the JDVD wasn’t all wasted as I used it’s DUB (yes it had the English dub don’t ask me why and it was better than the USDVD). But syncing that thing was a headache as It had different delays for all them episodes. So I had to go one by one and sync the whole thing reeeee. In the end I want to say thanks to @bob209 and @Jeff50 for finding errors in my past release for I would have missed them. 

P.S. I have no good idea of where to start so enjoy https://anidb.net/anime/409/relation/graph
P.S. This will take a day or more to download (12Mbps upload). Less when the seeds rechecks are done.
P.S. When that https://myanimelist.net/anime/40097 is finished airing I will probability update the torrent.
P.S. There’s only two which do not have dubs and its marked with "sub_only".
P.S. I did not touch any release’s file names that I did not mux or change.
